# VS Code Extension Development Summary

## Date: June 16, 2025
## Project: Burn Profiler MaxGraph Extension

### ✅ SOLVED: Multi-root Workspace Issue
**Problem**: Extension debugging failed when working in multi-root workspace (LinossRust + typscr folders)
- Launch.json conflicts between projects
- VS Code confused about which project context to use
- Commands not appearing in Command Palette

**Solution**: Use separate VS Code instances
- Open `/home/rustuser/typscr/extensionVS/extensionVS.code-workspace` in dedicated VS Code instance
- Keep LinossRust project in separate VS Code window
- Extension development works perfectly in isolated environment

### Current Working Extension Status
- Location: `/home/rustuser/typscr/burn-profiler-maxgraph/`
- Extension ID: `linoss-dev.burn-profiler-maxgraph`
- VSIX: `burn-profiler-maxgraph-0.0.1.vsix`
- ✅ "Hello World" command working in dedicated VS Code instance
- ✅ Debug with F5 working (Extension Development Host launches)

### Key Configuration Files
- `package.json`: Commands, publisher, version compatibility fixed
- `src/extension.ts`: Command registration working
- `.vscode/launch.json`: Debug configuration working
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript config with DOM lib
- `esbuild.js`: Build system working

### Commands for Development
```bash
cd /home/rustuser/typscr/burn-profiler-maxgraph/
npm run compile    # Compile TypeScript
npm run watch      # Watch mode for development
vsce package       # Package extension
code --install-extension burn-profiler-maxgraph-0.0.1.vsix
```

### Next Steps (TODO)
1. Add WebView panel for MaxGraph visualization
2. Add WebSocket client to connect to LinossRust burn profiler
3. Integrate MaxGraph library for neural network visualization
4. Stream real-time D-LinOSS brain dynamics data

### Lesson Learned
- Multi-root workspaces can cause conflicts in extension development
- Use dedicated VS Code instances for different project types (Rust vs TypeScript extensions)
- VS Code extension development requires clean, isolated environment

### Reference Chat Context
This summary covers the VS Code extension development session where we:
- Debugged command registration issues
- Fixed package.json configuration problems
- Resolved multi-root workspace conflicts
- Successfully got basic extension working with "Hello World" command
- Established foundation for neural network visualization features
