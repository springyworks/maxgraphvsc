=== VS Code Extension Console Analysis ===
Date: June 16, 2025

🎯 KEY FINDINGS:
✅ Extension IS loading: "INFO Loading development extension at /home/rustuser/typscr/extensionVS/maxgraphvsc"
✅ Extension Host started successfully: "Started local extension host with pid 2698464"
✅ No critical errors related to your extension

⚠️  ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- The extension is loading but you don't see the save/dump buttons
- This suggests the neural network visualizer may not be auto-opening
- The dump buttons only appear AFTER creating a neural network

🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:

1. **Manual Command Execution:**
   In the Extension Development Host window:
   - Press F1 (or Ctrl+Shift+P)
   - Type: "🅰️ Neural Network WASM Visualizer"
   - Press Enter

2. **Check Extensions List:**
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+X (Extensions sidebar)
   - Look for "🅰️ Neural Network WASM" under "Installed"

3. **Create Network First:**
   - Once the visualizer opens, click "🧠 Create Network"
   - THEN you should see: "📄 Dump Console" and "💾 Save to File" buttons

📋 NORMAL CONSOLE NOISE:
All the WARN/ERR messages are from OTHER extensions:
- ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare
- ms-python.gather  
- mermaidchart.vscode-mermaid-chart
- These are NOT related to your Neural Network extension

✨ YOUR EXTENSION STATUS: WORKING ✅
The console shows successful loading - the issue is likely UI/activation related.
